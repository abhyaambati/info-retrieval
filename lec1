IR - Structuring, storing, searching and retrieving info. efficiently
- deals with massive amounts of data (Amazon, Google, etc.)
- key challenge: computers deal with raw data, humans require information

Heirarchy of Information Needs:
1. Wandering: No clear goal (find a research topic)
2. Exploring: General goal (learn more about ai history)
3. Seeking: Open-ended information need (find impact of ai on jobs)
4. Asking specific-fact lookup: when was AI first used in healthcare?

Search Model Workflow:
[ Task -> Query -> Indexing -> Ranking ]
A user goes through these steps:
1. Task -> Info need -> Query (user types a search query)
2. Search Engine processes it (indexing, matching)
3. Results ranked based on revelance (bm25, tf-idf, etc.)
4. Uses Refine query if needed 

Challenges in IR:
1. Understanding queries efficiently
2. Rankings results accurately (which document should appear first)
3. handling large-scale data

Evolution of IR:
1. 50s-70s : basic sorting, searching, and data structures
2. 80s-90s : introduction of ranking models, indexing and web search (AltaVista, Excite)
3. 00s : Rise of Google, Knowledge graphs, Deep Learning in IR
4. 20S : Conversational IR (ChatGPT, Alexa, AI-Driven search)

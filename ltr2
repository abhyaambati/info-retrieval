 Click Data & Learning to Rank

(1) ..........................................................................................................................................................
Real-World Ranking Features
- ranking uses both query dependent and query independent features
a. query-ind : page quality, freshness, spam score
b. que-dep : relevance, clickthrough rate, user context
- click data is a powerful ranking signal but needs careful interpretation!

(2)..........................................................................................................................................................
Click data and biases in biases in user interactions
- CTR ( Clickthrough rate) : measures how often users click a search result
- biases in click data:
        - position bias : higher-rank results get more clicks,even if they arent the best
        - contextual bias : clicks depend on nearby results
        - presentation bias : formatting affects behaviour
- clicks dont always mean relevance, they can be misleading

(3) ..........................................................................................................................................................
Learning from clicks - models to reduce bias
- Position-Based models (PBM) : Adjust for position bias in CTR data
- cascade models : Assume users scan results top-down & stop when they find a good one.
- dynamic bayesian networks (DBN) : captures both probability and user satisfaction

*Better ranking models account for user behavior, not just raw click counts.

(4) Interleaving for online evaluation
- Interleaving compares two ranking functions in real user interactions.
- Types:
       - Balanced interleaving → Mixes two rankings & assigns credit based on clicks.
       - Team draft interleaving → Picks results alternately from two rankers.
- Why use it? More reliable than offline judgments, avoids biases.
- Interleaving helps compare ranking models in real-world conditions.

Personalized Search & Recommender Systems

(1) What is Personalized Search?
- Personalization tailors search results based on:
          - User behavior (past queries, clicks, dwell time).
          - Context (location, time, device).
          - User profiles (long-term interests, demographics).
- Goal: Improve search relevance by understanding the user.
Why personalize?
- A single ranking does not fit everyone.
- 46%-70% ranking improvements have been observed using personalization

(2) Challenges in Personalized Search
- Privacy Issues: Users may not want search engines to track behavior.
- Serendipity & Novelty: Over-personalization can limit diverse search results.
- Evaluation Problems: Difficult to measure effectiveness (explicit judgments vs. implicit signals).
Solution:
- Use short-term session data and long-term user profiles for balance.
- Personal navigation queries (repeat queries) provide strong signals for personalization.

(3) Recommender Systems – Collaborative Filtering (CF)
- Goal: Recommend items based on past interactions.
- Types:
       - User-based CF: Recommends based on similar users’ preferences.
       - Item-based CF: Recommends items similar to those a user has liked before.
       - Hybrid CF: Combines both approaches.
- Challenges in CF:
        - Cold Start: Hard to recommend items for new users.
        - Sparsity: Most users only rate a few items, making recommendations difficult.
        - Popularity Bias: Tends to recommend popular items over niche ones.      

(4) Content-Based Recommendations
- Recommends items based on item attributes (e.g., genre, actors, topic).
- Uses TF-IDF & cosine similarity to find similar items.
                               
- Pros & Cons:
✔️ Works well for new users (no reliance on other users).
❌ Limited diversity (recommends too similar items).
